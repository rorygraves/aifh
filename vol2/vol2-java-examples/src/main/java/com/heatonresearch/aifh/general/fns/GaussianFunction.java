/**
 * The Gaussian function is a Radial Basis Function that describes the typical "bell curve", or "normal distribution".
 * <p/>
 * The Gaussian function requires parameters that specify the width (over all dimensions), as well as the
 * centers of each dimension.  So a 3d Gaussian would have the parameters lined up as follows:
 * <p/>
 * params[0] = width (of all dimensions),
 * <p/>
 * params[1] = center of dimension 0,
 * <p/>
 * params[2] = center of dimension 1,
 * <p/>
 * params[3] = center of dimension 3
